# FITness
Web platform developed to manage collaborative work opportunities between software development cooperatives. 

This is a HackTic 2020 project by in which developers of cooperatives associated with FACTTIC participated.

## Goal
The main goal is to have a tool that facilitates the identification of available developers when a software development opportunity is brought to FIT by one of the cooperatives participating in it.

The expected workflow is to: create an opportunity > identify co-operatives that have developers available in the required technology > notify co-operatives that may come forward to take the opportunity.
